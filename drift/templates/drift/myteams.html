            <p>Teams make up a league and compete against each other. Each team includes a set of drivers, drafted by the team's owner. The owner can activate and deactivate racers for the next event, but once an event starts, the lineup is set. Any inactivate racers do not count toward that event's scoring. Changes made to the lineup will be reflected in the next event.</p>
