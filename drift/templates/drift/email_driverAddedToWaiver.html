You added {{racer.name}} to the waiver wire. Your waiver priority is {{team.waiverpriority.getLeagueOrderRank}} of {{team.waiverpriority.getLeagueOrder|length}}. Once {{team.league.waiver_hours}} hours pass, if the driver has not been selected by a higher priority team, they will be added to your team automatically and you will receive another notification.
